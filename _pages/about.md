I’m a backend software engineer with over 3 years of experience making sure systems work smoothly in industries like FinTech and Logistics. I enjoy building strong backend solutions that handle real-world challenges.

Though I’ve tried frontend development, I’m happiest working on the backend, solving tough problems. DevOps? Been there. Linux? My playground. I’m always learning, breaking things (on purpose), and finding better ways to fix them.
